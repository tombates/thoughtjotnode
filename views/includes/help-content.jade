#helpDialog(title='Getting Started with Thought Jot')
  p.usage
    | Welcome to Thought Jot, an online way to keep rich notes, or jots, that
    | you can tag.
  p.usage
    | This help window can be resized and moved so you can have it visible if you are a beginning jotter.
  p.usage
    | Thought Jot has a simple interface that supports jots with
    | text and images. Each jot can have a title and tags attached to it,
    | along with its content. You can use tags to organize your jots and you
    | can restrict or filter the jots you see using tags and date ranges.
  h1.usage Requirements
  p.usage
    | Thought Jot requires a modern browser such as recent versions of Chrome (31 or higher), Firefox
    | (31 or higher), or IE 9 or later.
  p.usage
    | Currently Thought Jot also requires full support of HTML5 IndexedDB in order to retain locally your
    | most recent filter criteria.
    | Unfortunately, Safari still does not have full IndexedDB support. A future version will remove this restriction.
  h1.usage First things first: telling Thought Jot where to store your jots
  p.usage
    | Thought Jot stores your jots remotely in a document database.
    | When you first go to Thought Jot,
    | you will see an account login/create account dialog. You can create an account by entering an email address and a password or you
    | can use the Guest account with email guest@nowhere.com and password GuestPass1 if you just want to see how things work.
  p.usage
    | The Guest account is global, meaning you will be entering jots
    | that can be seen by anyone else who uses the Guest account. In addition, guest jots will not be retained for
    | more than 24 hours. So to really use Thought Jot, you need to create an account.
  h1.usage Jotting
  p.usage
    | New jots are created in the compose area at the top of the page. For simple jots, just type
    | your content.
  p.usage
    | You can also add images from other web pages by copying the image and pasting it into the jot. To do this
    | you use the context menu (right click on Windows, Ctrl-click on Mac) when your mouse is over the image you want to copy.
    | From the menu select "copy image." Returning to Thought Jot's compose area (or a jot you are editing) you then just use
    | the paste command and your image should be inserted. This assumes the sight allows the context menu and the site's server
    | allows cross-domain access to the image.
  p.usage
    | When you click the plus button just below the lower left corner of the composing area, your new jot will be
    | added to the jots visible below the compose area. Each jot gets a blue header with the jot's title, tags, creation date
    | and time, an edit button and a delete button.
  p.usage
    | You can give your jot a title in the Title input field below the compose area. If you don&apos;t enter a title, Thought
    | Jot will create a title
    | from either the first 50 characters of the contents, or the first sentence (defined as text ending with ".",
    | "?", "!"), or a new line (that is, a return),
    | whichever is shortest. If you don't like the default title, or a title you explicitly entered, you can easily edit it later.
  p.usage
    | The displayed jots can be ordered with the newest or oldest jots at the top. Below the add button is
    | the re-order button. If you hover your pointer over it you will see the alternate ordering you will get if you click it.
    | If you entered a new jot and didn&apos;t see it appear, you&apos;re probably showing oldest jots first and so the new one went to
    | the bottom. If so, just hit the reorder button.
  h1.usage Editing, collapsing, and deleting jots
  p.usage
    | Any visible jot&apos;s content, title, and tags can be edited. To put a jot into editing mode
    | click on the pencil icon on the left of the blue jot header. This will make the pencil turn into a check mark and
    | the editable areas will turn light green. When you are done editing, click the check mark. Only one jot can be
    | edited at a time.
  p.usage
    | You can collapse a jot to show only its blue header. You do this by clicking somewhere in the
    | blue header that is not directly on the title, tags, or datestamp regions. The same operation will expand a collapsed jot.
  p.usage
    | You can delete a jot by clicking the X on the right side of a jot's blue header. You can also delete
    | several jots by selecting the
    | checkbox to the left of the delete X for each jot and then choosing "Delete selected jots" from the [YOUR NAME] menu
    | in the upper right corner of the page. If you want to delete all or most of the jots showing, use the check-all box on the left
    | just above the first jot and then uncheck the jots you don't want deleted.
  p.usage
    |You will be asked to confirm any deletion action. Currently, deleting jots is not undoable. 
  h1.usage Tagging
  p.usage
    | You can attach tags to jots either when you first make a new jot or later. Tags allow you to see a subset of all
    | your jots.
  p.usage
    | At first there won&apos;t be any tags in your Tag Selector list. To add tags to the Tag Selector, type
    | them in the Tags input field and click the Merge button. Tags can contain spaces, so when typing multiple tags into
    | the Tags input field they need to be separated by commas. Tags themselves cannot contain commas or start with a minus
    | sign or dash (-). Tags are case sensitive: "some tag" is a different tag than "Some tag". Tags must be added to the
    | Tag Selector using the Merge button to be used for filtering.
  p.usage
    | If you want to delete a tag from the Tag Selector then
    | type it in the Tags input field preceeded by a dash or minus sign (-), then click Merge and it will be removed if it is
    | currently in the tag list. Deleted tags are removed only from the Tag Selector, not from jots that are already tagged
    | with them. If you delete a tag by mistake, you can add it back by typing it in the Tags field again and clicking the
    | Merge button.
  p.usage
    | You can select tags in the Tag Selector list. Click for one tag, then ctrl-click to select more, or ctrl-click
    | an already selected tag to unselect it. Once you have selected your desired set of tags,
    | click the Stage Tags button. The selected tags will replace any tags in the Tags input field.
    | Alternatively you can just type tags into the Tags input field, separated by commas.
  h1.usage Filtering
  p.usage
    | You can filter or restrict the jots that are displayed to show subsets of your jots. You can
    | filter based on tags or date ranges.
    strong  Only tags that exist in the Tag Selector can be used as filter criteria.
  p.usage
    | To filter by tags, select the tags in the Tag Selector to the right of the compose area,
    | check the By Tags checkbox under Filter Options and select either the OR or AND options.
  p.usage
    | To filter by dates, check the By Date Range checkbox. Then click in either or both of the date fields to
    | get a calendar. If you provide only one date you will see only jots made on that date. If you provide two dates (the order
    | is not important) you will see all jots created on or between the two dates.
  p.usage
    | Once you&apos;ve set up your filtering criteria, click the Filter button. If you add a new jot that does not
    | meet the current filter criteria, it will still show (otherwise, you might wonder if it really got added).
    | You can just click the Filter button again if you don&apos;t want your new jot to show, or collapse it.
  h1.usage Understanding where jots, tags and filters are stored
  p.usage
    | Your jots and tags are stored remotely in a document database called MongoDB and Thought Jot is hosted at Heroku.com. The
    | back-end of Thought Jot is a node.js application. 
  p.usage
    | Your most recent filter settings are stored in your account. Different people can use Thought Jot on the same computer
    | and as long as they log in under different accounts their stored filter settings will remain distinct. And of course, your
    | jots and tags themselves are always separate.
  h1.usage That's it, mostly...
  p.usage
    | I wrote Thought Jot partly as a node.js exercise, but even more because I've always wanted a good browser-based
    | alternative to my other method of keeping track of all my thoughts and reminders, namely random piles of paper layering
    | my desk like a biofilm.
  p.usage I wanted to be able to control and play around with the feature set, so naturally I had to write it
    | myself. I now keep it open pretty much all the time and the surface of my desk is becoming visible again. I think that's
    | cherry wood under there. Who knew.
  p.usage Jolly jotting!
